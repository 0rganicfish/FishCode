Ox, Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon, Snake, Horse, Goat, Monkey, Rooster, Dog, Pig, Rat

假设：B = OX = 1

M = B - 9 = Dragon
G = M - 8 = -B - 17 = Monkey
E = G + 5 = -B - 12 = Ox
P = B + 9 = Dog

peo[G] = 8, peo[M] = 

peo[M] = 4, peo[B] = 1, f = prev --> ans = 4 - 1 - 12 = -9
peo[G] = 8, peo[M] = -9, --> ans = 17 - 12 = 5
peo[E] = 1, peo[G] = 8,
